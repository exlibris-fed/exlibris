`exlibris` is a social network dedicated to tracking and discussing what you're reading.

This will be filled out more once we have a more fleshed out project.

It was created during the 2020 employee hackathon at [ACV Auctions](https://acvauctions.com) and is being actively developed by its maintaners afterward.
